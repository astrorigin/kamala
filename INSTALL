Swiss Ephemeris files
=====================

For the application to start correctly, the contents of
`ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/` must be found in a local directory.

The following paths will be tested for existence and the first
one to be found will be chosen as default (this path can later be changed to
anything else, in the preferences dialog, however it is strongly recommended
to follow these guidelines, as there is a growing number of applications using
them):
`/usr/share/swisseph`, `/usr/local/share/swisseph`, `/share/swisseph`,
`/usr/opt/swisseph`, `/usr/local/opt/swisseph`, `/opt/swisseph`.

Here is an example of a normal install:

    ``mkdir /usr/local/share/swisseph``

    ``cd /usr/local/share/swisseph``

Not all files are necessary! The following (recommended) is everything needed
to get started (about 41M):

    ``wget ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/*``

A minimal install example (about 2M, from 1800 AD to 2300 AD, without fixed
stars, etc):

    ``wget ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/archive_gzip/sweph_18.tar.gz``

    ``tar zxf sweph_18.tar.gz``

In doubt, read more at ``ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/ephe/README.TXT``
